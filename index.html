    <h3> Webpage Description: </h3>
    <p> 
      Welcome to my website! Here, you'll find a unique platform designed specifically for actors rehearsing a play inspired by "The Office." This website offers a convenient and interactive way to engage with the script, allowing actors to seamlessly navigate through their characters' lines.

      Actors can simply touch or click on their character's name within the play. This action will highlight their lines, making it easier to identify and focus on their specific dialogue during rehearsals. This feature allows actors to efficiently practice their lines and perfect their performances.

    <div id="play">
      <p><span data-actor="Michael">"Michael: Alright, team! Today, we're going to do some team-building exercises. Get ready for some fun!</span> </p>
      <p><span data-actor="Jim">"Jim: Oh, this should be interesting."</span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="Dwight">"Dwight: I'm ready, Michael! I'm always up for team-building exercises. They make us stronger!"</span></p> 
      <p><span data-actor="Michael">"Michael: That's the spirit, Dwight! Okay, first up, we're going to do the Trust Fall."</span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="Jim">"Jim: Seriously, Michael? We've done this before."</span></p> 
      <p><span data-actor="Michael">"Michael: Well, this time we're adding a twist. Dwight, you'll be catching Jim. Jim, you'll be catching me. And I'll catch... myself!"</span></p> 
      <p><span data-actor="Jim">"Jim: You're going to catch yourself?"</span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="Michael">"Michael: Yes, Jim! I am my own safety net. It's a metaphor for leadership."</span></p> 
      <p><span data-actor="Dwight">"Dwight: It's a metaphor for idiocy"<span></p> 
      <p><span data-actor="Jim">"Jim: Alright, Michael. Let's do this."</span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="Michael">"Michael: Here we go! Three, two, one... Trust fall!"</span></p>
